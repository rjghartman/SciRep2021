# Sex-dependent gene co-expression in the human body

R code associated with *Sex-dependent gene co-expression in the human body*.

RDS files containing the permutations of sex-bias over all tested tissues. One that contains genes co-expressed more strongly in females (designated "Genelist per permutation by tissue female.RDS") and one with genes co-expressed more strongly in males (designated "Genelist per permutation by tissue male.RDS").

The R script describes how the GTEx data is cleaned and used for the determination of sex-biased genes.
Sex-biased genes are genes that show differential co-expression between the sexes.
